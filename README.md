# ToolHive - simplify and secure MCP servers

**Run any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server ‚Äî securely, instantly, anywhere.**

ToolHive is the easiest way to discover, deploy, and manage MCP servers. Launch
any MCP server in a locked-down container with just a few clicks. No manual
setup, no security headaches, no runtime hassles.

## Why ToolHive?

- **Instant deployment:** Start any MCP server with a simple graphical workflow.
- **Secure by default:** Every server runs in an isolated container with only
  the permissions it needs. Secrets are managed securely, never in plaintext.
- **Works everywhere:** Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Seamless integration:** ToolHive auto-configures popular clients like GitHub
  Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, and more.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) installed
  and running (Docker Desktop / Podman Desktop are recommended)
- If you are using Linux, make sure your user is in the `docker` group
  ([reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)).

### Install ToolHive

Download and install the latest release of the ToolHive for your platform:

- macOS (Apple Silicon):
  [download the DMG file](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive.dmg),
  open it, and drag the ToolHive app to your Applications folder.
- Windows:
  [download the installer](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest/download/ToolHive.Setup.exe)
  and run it.
  > [!NOTE]  
  > The Windows installer is not digitally signed yet, so you might need to
  > accept warnings from Windows Defender SmartScreen. We're working on getting
  > signing set up soon.
- Linux: download the RPM or DEB package from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-studio/releases/latest)
  and install it using your package manager.

### Run your first MCP server

The ToolHive UI has four main areas:

- **Installed**: View and manage your installed MCP servers.
- **Registry**: Browse and install servers from the curated registry of official
  and community servers.
- **Clients**: Automatically connect your favorite clients to MCP servers.
- **Secrets**: Securely manage sensitive data required by many MCP servers.

Start by installing a simple MCP server from the registry:

1. On the **Installed** tab, click **Add server** and choose **From the
   registry**. Or, open the **Registry** tab to browse available servers.

2. Select the "fetch" server from the list. Fetch is a simple MCP server that
   fetches data from the web.

3. Click **Install server** to start the server.

4. Once the server is running, click **View** on the notification or open the
   **Installed** tab to see its status.

5. Open the **Clients** tab to connect your favorite client (e.g., GitHub
   Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code). For a list of supported clients, see the
   [ToolHive documentation](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive/reference/client-compatibility).

6. Open your client and start using the MCP server!

## How it works

Under the hood, ToolHive runs each MCP server in its own secure container and
exposes an HTTP/SSE proxy that MCP clients connect to.

</picture>

For more advanced use cases, ToolHive is also available as a command-line tool
which can be used standalone or side-by-side with the ToolHive UI and as a
Kubernetes Operator. Learn more in the
[ToolHive documentation](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive/).

## Privacy and Telemetry

ToolHive uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking and performance
monitoring to help us identify and fix issues, improve stability, and enhance
the user experience. This telemetry is enabled by default but completely
optional.

### What data is collected?

- Error reports and crash logs
- Performance metrics
- Usage patterns

### How to opt out

You can easily disable telemetry at any time:

1. Open ToolHive
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the top navigation)
3. Find the **Telemetry** section
4. Toggle off telemetry collection
